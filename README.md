My Notes on https://e-discoveryteam.com/tar-course/

This is an online course provided by Ralph Losey.

My current plan is to break these notes into sections by class and update this readme with links as I complete each 'class'.

For those stumbling onto this: I am a humble software developer working on a software-product in this space. All my links/contact info can be found at https://www.matthewjosephtaylor.com

I hope you find these notes helpful, but understand that these are my 'raw study notes' and so will reflect my own perspective and understanding at the moment and time I'm going through this course. Feel free to glean from them what insights you can, but understand I am a student not a master (_especially_ when it comes to the legal side) :)
